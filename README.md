# TheGif
This website shows off my ability to import APIs, creating more dynamic websites.

# How to use
Choose the amount of gifs to display by clicking the side counter on the left of your screen. Once set, you can either click on a catergory or type in a new category of your choice from the search bar. Once that catergory is selected, a row of gifs should be displayed. Click on a gif to bring it to life!
